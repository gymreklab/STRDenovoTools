# CookieMonSTR

Toolkit for calling and analyzing de novo STR mutations.
This repository is under construction but is planned for official release soon.

The core code for calling de novos is modified from that originally written by Thomas Willems in the [HipSTR](https://github.com/tfwillems/HipSTR) repository.
